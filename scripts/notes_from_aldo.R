# Collab with Aldo

# Paper Structure
# Open with Refuting Ewers for recent years

# Hypotheses to test

#  - GM cause huge gains in Developing rather than Developed countries
#  - Yield changes are less predictive of land area changes that other metrics
#     - Nitrogen and pesticide use, and export values are significant predictors of area change
#     - However, are highly influenced by/correlated with HDI 
#  - 
#  - How have yield gaps closed in recent years, effects over time? Specific crops? What countries?
#  -    Isolate top producing countries, specific crops, shorter time chunks
#  - 

# Considerations

# - Setting thresholds on ag area or economic area to remove tiny countries (removes almost exclusively outliers)

# To Do
#
# - Create new datasheet with total cropland area value 
# -   With calories excluded now can focus on yield 
# -
