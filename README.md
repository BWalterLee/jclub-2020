Repo of data, analysis, and plots from WSU Ento Journal Club 2020-21 

** Scripts for plotting and analysis are in the "scripts" folder ** 

If you want to replicate any of the plots or analyses, download this entire folder and set the working directory to "Source File Location". If working within the folder, then data should be pulled from the "data" folder automatically. 

Journal club folks, if you have trouble accessing any of this stuff or any questions feel free to email me at benjamin.w.lee@wsu.edu
